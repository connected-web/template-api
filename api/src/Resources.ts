/**
 * Resources
 *
 * Add all the resources you want in your API to this class
 * The shared Resources object is used to create resources that are shared by multiple routes
 * This is useful for resources that are used by multiple routes, such as a bucket for storing data
 * Think of this as a way to create resources that need to be between routes, or a simple form of dependency injection
 *
 * Getters are recommended so that you can late bind as many values as possible for test purposes.
 *
 * @param scope Construct scope for this construct
 * @param stack Stack object for this construct
 * @param config StackParameters object containing configuration values for this API
